*   Representative player chooses at each node where they go. They has an

### Mean Field Game : Linear-Quadratic

*   Players are uniformly distributed and are then incentivized to gather at the
    same point (The lower the distanbce wrt. the distribution mean position, the
    higher the reward). A mean-reverting term pushes the players towards the
    distribution, a gaussian noise term perturbs them. The players' actions
    alter their states linearly (alpha * a * dt) and the cost thereof is
    quadratic (K * a^2 * dt), hence the name. There exists an exact, closed form
    solution for the fully continuous version of this game.
*   Research game.
*   Mean-field (with a unique player).
