### Mean Field Game : Linear-Quadratic

*   Players are uniformly distributed and are then incentivized to gather at the

    distribution, a gaussian noise term perturbs them. The players' actions
    alter their states linearly (alpha * a * dt) and the cost thereof is
    quadratic (K * a^2 * dt), hence the name. There exists an exact, closed form
    solution for the fully continuous version of this game.

### Routing game

*   Players choose at each node where they go. They have an origin, a
    destination and a departure time and choose their route to minimize their
    travel time. Time spent on each link is a function of the number of players
    on the link when the player reaches the link.
*   Network with choice of route.
*   Research game.
*   Simultaneous.
*   Deterministic.
*   Perfect information.
*   Any number of players.

*   Bargaining game.
*   Deterministic.
*   Imperfect information.
