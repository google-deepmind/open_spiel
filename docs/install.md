# Installation

## Python-only installation via pip

If you plan to only use the Python API, then the easiest way to install
OpenSpiel is to use pip. On MacOS or Linux, simply run:

```
python3 -m pip install open_spiel
```

The binary distribution is new as of OpenSpiel 1.0.0, and is only supported on
x86_64 architectures. If you encounter any problems, you can still install
OpenSpiel via pip from source (see below), but please open an issue to let us
know about the problem.

### Python-only installation via pip (from source).

If the binary distribution is not an option, you can also build OpenSpiel via
pip from source. CMake, Clang and Python 3 development files are required to
build the Python extension. Note that we recommend Clang but g++ >= 9.2 should
also work.

E.g. on Ubuntu or Debian:

```bash
# Check to see if you have the necessary tools for building OpenSpiel:
cmake --version        # Must be >= 3.17
clang++ --version      # Must be >= 7.0.0
python3-config --help

# If not, run this line to install them.
# On older Linux distros, the package might be called clang-9 or clang-10
sudo apt-get install cmake clang python3-dev

# On older Linux distros, the versions may be too old.
# E.g. on Ubuntu 18.04, there are a few extra steps:
# sudo apt-get install clang-10
# pip3 install cmake  # You might need to relogin to get the new CMake version
# export CXX=clang++-10

# Recommended: Install pip dependencies and run under virtualenv.
sudo apt-get install virtualenv python3-virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Finally, install OpenSpiel and its dependencies:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
python3 -m pip install --no-binary=:open_spiel: open_spiel

# To exit the virtual env
deactivate

## **IMPORTANT NOTE**. If the build fails, please first make sure you have the
## required versions of the tools above and that you followed the recommended
## option. Then, open an issue: https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues
```

Note that the build could take several minutes.

On MacOS, you can install the dependencies via `brew install cmake python3`. For
clang, you need to install or upgrade XCode and install the command-line
developer tools.

## Installation from Source

The instructions here are for Linux and MacOS. For installation on Windows, see
[these separate installation instructions](windows.md). On Linux, we recommend
Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 10, or later versions. On MacOS, we recommend XCode 11 or
newer. For the Python API: our tests run using Python versions 3.7 - 3.10. If
you encounter any problems on other setups, please let us know by opening an
issue.

Currently there are three installation methods:

1.  building from the source code and editing `PYTHONPATH`.
2.  using `pip install` to build and testing using
    [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/).
3.  installing via [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Summary

In a nutshell:

```bash
./install.sh  # Needed to run once and when major changes are released.
./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh # Run this every-time you need to rebuild.
```

1.  (Optional) Configure
    [Conditional Dependencies](#configuring-conditional-dependencies).
2.  Install system packages (e.g. cmake) and download some dependencies. Only
    needs to be run once or if you enable some new conditional dependencies.

    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

3.  Install your [Python dependencies](#installing-python-dependencies), e.g. in
    Python 3 using
    [`virtualenv`](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/):

    ```bash
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Use `deactivate` to quit the virtual environment.

    `pip` should be installed once and upgraded:

    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    # Install pip deps as your user. Do not use the system's pip.
    python3 get-pip.py
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install --upgrade setuptools testresources
    ```

    Additionally, if you intend to use one of the
    optional Python dependencies (see [open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh)), you
    must manually install and/or upgrade them, e.g.: `bash pip install --upgrade
    torch==x.xx.x jax==x.x.x` where `x.xx.x` should be the desired version
    numbers (which can be found at the link above).

4.  This sections differs depending on the installation procedure:

    **Building and testing from source**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./open_spiel/scripts/build_and_run_tests.sh
    ```

    **Building and testing using PIP**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    python3 -m pip install nox
    nox -s tests
    ```

    Optionally, use `pip install -e` to install in
    [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs),
    which will allow you to skip this `pip install` step if you edit any Python
    source files. If you edit any C++ files, you will have to rerun the install
    command.

5.  Only when building from source:

    ```bash
    # For the python modules in open_spiel.
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
    # For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
    ```

    to `./venv/bin/activate` or your `~/.bashrc` to be able to import OpenSpiel
    from anywhere.

To make sure OpenSpiel works on the default configurations, we do use the
`python3` command and not `python` (which still defaults to Python 2 on modern
Linux versions).

## Installing via Docker

Please note that we don't regularly test the Docker installation. As such, it
may not work at any given time. If you encounter a problem, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues).

Option 1 (Basic, 3.13GB):

```bash
docker build --target base -t openspiel -f Dockerfile.base .
```

Option 2 (Slim, 2.26GB):

```bash
docker build --target python-slim -t openspiel -f Dockerfile.base .
```

If you are only interested in developing in Python, use the second image. You
can navigate through the runtime of the container (after the build step) with:

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash openspiel
```

Finally you can run examples using:

```bash
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/matrix_game_example.py
docker run openspiel python3 python/examples/example.py
```


Option 3 (Jupyter Notebook):

Installs OpenSpiel with an additional Jupyter Notebook environment.

```bash
docker build -t openspiel-notebook -f Dockerfile.jupyter --rm .
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 openspiel-notebook
```

_More info_: https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Running the first examples

In the `build` directory, running `examples/example` will prints out a list of
registered games and the usage. Now, letâ€™s play game of Tic-Tac-Toe with uniform
random players:

```bash
examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

Once the proper Python paths are set, from the main directory (one above
`build`), try these out:

```bash
# Similar to the C++ example:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/example.py --game=breakthrough

# Play a game against a random or MCTS bot:
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=random
python3 open_spiel/python/examples/mcts.py --game=tic_tac_toe --player1=human --player2=mcts
```

## Detailed steps

### Configuring conditional dependencies

Conditional dependencies are configured using environment variables, e.g.

```bash
export OPEN_SPIEL_BUILD_WITH_HANABI=ON
```

`install.sh` may need to be rerun after enabling new conditional dependencies.

See [open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh) for the full list
of conditional dependencies.

See also the [Developer Guide](developer_guide.md#conditional-dependencies).

### Installing system-wide dependencies

See [open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh) for the required packages and cloned
repositories.

### Installing Python dependencies

Using a `virtualenv` to install python dependencies is highly recommended. For
more information see:
[https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

##### Required dependencies

Install required dependencies (Python 3):

```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04 and newer:
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Older than Ubuntu 22.04:
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, although not recommended, you can install the Python dependencies
system-wide with:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

##### Optional dependencies

Additionally, if you intend to use one of the optional Python dependencies (see [open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh)), you must manually install and/or upgrade them. The installation scripts will not install or upgrade these dependencies. e.g.:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade torch==x.xx.x jax==x.x.x
```

where `x.xx.x` should be the desired version numbers (which can be found at the
link above).

### Building and running tests

Make sure that the virtual environment is still activated.

By default, Clang C++ compiler is used (and potentially installed by
[open_spiel/scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/open_spiel/scripts/install.sh)).

Build and run tests (Python 3):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
CXX=clang++ cmake -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${CXX} ../open_spiel
make -j$(nproc)
ctest -j$(nproc)
```

The CMake variable `Python3_EXECUTABLE` is used to specify the Python
interpreter. If the variable is not set, CMake's FindPython3 module will prefer
the latest version installed. Note, Python >= 3.7 is required.

One can run an example of a game running (in the `build/` folder):

```bash
./examples/example --game=tic_tac_toe
```

### Setting Your PYTHONPATH environment variable

To be able to import the Python code (both the C++ binding `pyspiel` and the
rest) from any location, you will need to add to your PYTHONPATH the root
directory and the `open_spiel` directory.

When using a virtualenv, the following should be added to
`<virtualenv>/bin/activate`. For a system-wide install, ddd it in your `.bashrc`
or `.profile`.

```bash
# For the python modules in open_spiel.
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>
# For the Python bindings of Pyspiel
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/<path_to_open_spiel>/build/python
```
