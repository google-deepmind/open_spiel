OpenSpiel is a collection of environments and algorithms for research in general
reinforcement learning and search/planning in games. OpenSpiel supports n-player
(single- and multi- agent) zero-sum, cooperative and general-sum, one-shot and
sequential, strictly turn-taking and simultaneous-move, perfect and imperfect
information games, as well as traditional multiagent environments such as
(partially- and fully- observable) grid worlds and social dilemmas. OpenSpiel
also includes tools to analyze learning dynamics and other common evaluation
metrics. Games are represented as procedural extensive-form games, with some
natural extensions. The core API and games are implemented in C++ and exposed to
Python. Algorithms and tools are written both in C++ and Python. There is also a
branch of pure Swift in the `swift` subdirectory.
