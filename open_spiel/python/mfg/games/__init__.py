"""Mean field games implemented in Python.

These games are registered as they are imported. It's perfectly possible to
import just a single game if you prefer. There is no need to add new games here,
so long as they register themselves and you import them when wanting to use
them. However, adding them here will make them available for playthroughs and
for automated API testing.

Registration looks like this:
```
pyspiel.register_game(_GAME_TYPE, KuhnPokerGame)
```
