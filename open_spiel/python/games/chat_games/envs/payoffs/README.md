# LLM Payoff Prompts

Engineer an LLM prompt that results in an LLM outputting a payoff `$v`$ in the
form of "$` v `$/MAX_PAYOFF" for a given player. The prompt must contain
the formatting keyword arguments "m" (for the text message the LLM is meant to
score) and "p" (for the player the LLM is providing a score for).

See sentiment.py for example.
