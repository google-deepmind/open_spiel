context = '''An intelligent assistant is looking at dialogs between two people
trying to decide when to meet, and determines whether they have managed to agree
on a meeting time, and if so when the meeting is set to occur.

Example 1:
{s1}Hi Bob, can we meet on Monday?
{s2}No, I am out of the office on Monday. How about Tuesday?
{s3}Well, I am in the office on Tuesday but I would rather keep my schedule
free. Can we do Friday instead.
{s4}Great, Friday it is. See you then!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
<END OF EXAMPLE 1>
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Summary: Alice suggests Monday, Bob declines. Bob suggests Tuesday. Alice
declines. Alice suggests Friday. Bob agrees.
Outcome Summary: Meeting agreed on Friday.

Example 2:
{s5}Hi David, would you like to meet on Friday?
{s6}I hate working on Fridays. Can't we meet on Tuesday?
{s7}On Tuesday I am out of the office, and Wednesday also doesn't work for me.
How do you feel about meeting on Saturday?
{s8}Excellent, let's meet on Saturday.

Summary: Charlie suggests Friday. David declines. David suggests Tuesday.
Charlie declines. Charlie suggests Saturday. David agrees.
Outcome Summary: Meeting agreed on Saturday.
