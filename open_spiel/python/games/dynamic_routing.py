"""Implementation of dynamic routing game.

This dynamic routing game models the evolution of N vehicles in a road network.
The vehicles are described by their current link location, the time they have to
spend on the link before exiting it, and their destination. The action of a
vehicle is the successor link they want to reach when exiting a given link.
Actions are encoded as integer from 0 to K. Action 0 encodes not being able to
move on a successor link because the waiting time of the player is still
positive. Actions 1 to K correspond to the indices of the network links. Legal
actions for a player on link l, with a negative waiting time are the indices of
the successors link of l. When arriving on a link, the waiting time of the
player is assign based on the number of players on the link at this time. Over
time steps, the waiting time linearly decrease until it is negative, the vehicle
moves to a successor link and the waiting time get reassigned.
The cost of the vehicle is its travel time, it could be seen as a running cost
where +1 is added to the cost at any time step the vehicle is not on its
destination.
This dynamic routing game is a mesoscopic traffic model with explicit congestion
dynamics where vehicle minimizes their travel time.

The game is defined by:
- a network given by the class Network.
- a list of vehicles given by the class Vehicle.

The current game is implementated as a N player game. However this game can also
be extended to a mean field game, implemented as python_mfg_dynamic_routing.
