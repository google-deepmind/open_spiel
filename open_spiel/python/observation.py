"""An observation of a game.

This is intended to be the main way to get observations of states in Python.
The usage pattern is as follows:

0. Create the game we will be playing
1. Create each kind of observation required, using `make_observation`
2. Every time a new observation is required, call:
      `observation.set_from(state, player)`
   The tensor contained in the Observation class will be updated with an
   observation of the supplied state. This tensor is updated in-place, so if
   you wish to retain it, you must make a copy.

The following options are available when creating an Observation:
 - perfect_recall: if true, each observation must allow the observing player to
   reconstruct their history of actions and observations.
 - public_info: if true, the observation should include public information
 - private_info: specifies for which players private information should be
   included - all players, the observing player, or no players
 - params: game-specific parameters for observations

We ultimately aim to have all games support all combinations of these arguments.
However, initially many games will only support the combinations corresponding
to ObservationTensor and InformationStateTensor:
 - ObservationTensor: perfect_recall=False, public_info=True,
   private_info=SinglePlayer
 - InformationStateTensor: perfect_recall=True, public_info=True,
   private_info=SinglePlayer

Three formats of observation are supported:
a. 1-D numpy array, accessed by `observation.tensor`
b. Dict of numpy arrays, accessed by `observation.dict`. These are pieces of the
   1-D array, reshaped. The np.array objects refer to the same memory as the
   1-D array (no copying!).
c. String, hopefully human-readable (primarily for debugging purposes)

For usage examples, see `observation_test.py`.
