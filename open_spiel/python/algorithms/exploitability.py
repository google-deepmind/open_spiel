"""Compute the exploitability of a bot / strategy in a 2p sequential game.

This computes the value that a policy achieves against a worst-case opponent.
The policy applies to both player 1 and player 2, and hence we have a 2-player
symmetric zero-sum game, so the game value is zero for both players, and hence
value-vs-best-response is equal to exploitability.

We construct information sets, each consisting of a list of (state, probability)
pairs where probability is a counterfactual reach probability, i.e. the
probability that the state would be reached if the best responder (the current
player) played to reach it. This is the product of the probabilities of the
necessary chance events and opponent action choices required to reach the node.

These probabilities give us the correct weighting for possible states of the
world when considering our best response for a particular information set.

The values we calculate are values of being in the specific state. Unlike in a
CFR algorithm, they are not weighted by reach probabilities. These values
take into account the whole state, so they may depend on information which is
unknown to the best-responding player.
