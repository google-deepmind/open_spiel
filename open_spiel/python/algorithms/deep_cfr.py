"""Implements Deep CFR Algorithm.

See https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00164.

The algorithm defines an `advantage` and `strategy` networks that compute
advantages used to do regret matching across information sets and to approximate
the strategy profiles of the game. To train these networks a reservoir buffer
(other data structures may be used) memory is used to accumulate samples to
train the networks.
