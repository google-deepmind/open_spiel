"""Regression counterfactual regret minimization (RCFR) [Waugh et al., 2015; Morrill, 2016].

In contrast to (tabular) counterfactual regret minimization (CFR)
[Zinkevich et al., 2007], RCFR replaces the table of regrets that generate the
current policy profile with a profile of regression models. The average
policy is still tracked exactly with a full game-size table. The exploitability
of the average policy in zero-sum games decreases as the model accuracy and
the number of iterations increase [Waugh et al., 2015; Morrill, 2016]. As long
as the regression model errors decrease across iterations, the average policy
converges toward a Nash equilibrium in zero-sum games.
