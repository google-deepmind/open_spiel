A general implementation of voting rules from computational social choice.

This code implements the voting rules in Voting as Evaluation (VasE): Lanctot et
al.
[Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121).

It also includes a few example uses of running VasE on the Atari datasets
referenced in the paper.
