# This file contains the global variables that control conditional dependencies.
# It is being used to know whether we should:
# (a) download a dependency (done in install.sh)
# (b) build it and link against it during the `cmake` build process
#
# Note that we do not change the value of the constants if they are already
# defined by an enclosing scope (useful for command line overrides).

# We add a single flag, to enable/disable all conditional dependencies, in
# particular to be able to use that in the Travis CI test.

# "$DEFAULT_OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY" if undefined. To enable an optional dependency,
# we recomment defining the associated environment variable in your bashrc or
