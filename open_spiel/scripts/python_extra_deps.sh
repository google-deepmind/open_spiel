# These are extra packages that are not strictly required to run the OpenSpiel
# Python API, but are required by certain algorithms or tools. Packages here
# are for testing purposes: they are not installed by any of the install
# scripts, and are referred to only in the testing scripts run on GitHub, so
# they must installed separately. The versions are pinned to ensure that tests
# are covering only those versions supported by the algorithms that use them,
# but could work for other versions too.
#
# To enable specific tests, please use the environment variables found in
# scripts/global_variables.sh
