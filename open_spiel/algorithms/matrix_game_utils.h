// Note that this matrix game will have a row (respectively column) for each
// deterministic policy in the extensive-form game. As such, it will be
// exponentially larger than the extensive-form game. In particular, if S_i is
// number of information states for player i, and A(s_i) for s_i in S_i is the
// set of legal actions at s_i, then the number of deterministic policies is
// the product \Prod_{s_i in S_i) |A(s_i)|, and can include many redundant
// policies that differ, e.g., only in unreachable states. See Chapter 5 of
// (Shoham and Leyton-Brown, Multiagent Systems Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and
// Logical Foundations, 2009, http://masfoundations.org/) for more detail,
// including examples of the transformations.
//
// Hence, this method should only be used for  small games! For example, Kuhn
