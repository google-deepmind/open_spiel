# C++ AlphaZero

This is a C++ implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm.

For more information on the algorithm, please take a look at the
[full documentation](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/docs/alpha_zero.md).

[TensorflowCC library](https://github.com/mrdaliri/tensorflow_cc/tree/open_spiel)
should be installed on your machine. Please see
[this fork of tensorflow_cc](https://github.com/mrdaliri/tensorflow_cc/tree/open_spiel)
for instructions on building and installing.

After having a working TensorflowCC API, you just need to set
`BUILD_WITH_TENSORFLOW_CC` flag to `ON` before building OpenSpiel.
