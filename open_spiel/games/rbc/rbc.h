// Reconnaisance Blind Chess - imperfect information version of chess, where
// players do not see the full board, but they can make explicit "sensing" moves
// to reveal specific parts of the board.
//
// Specifically, based on [1,2] the implementation follow these rules:
//
// - The rules of Standard Chess apply, with the exceptions and modifications
//   that follow.
// - A player cannot see where her opponent's pieces are.
// - Prior to making each move a player selects a 3 x 3 square of the chess
//   board. She learns of all pieces and their types within that square. The
//   opponent is not informed about where she sensed.
// - If a player captures a piece, she is informed that she made a capture (but
//   she is not informed about what she captured).
// - If a player's piece is captured, she is informed that her piece on the
//   relevant square was captured (but she is not informed about what captured
//   it).
// - There is no notion of check or mate (since neither player may be aware of
//   any check relationship).
// - A player wins by capturing the opponent's king.
// - If a player tries to move a sliding piece through an opponent's piece, the
//   opponent's piece is captured and the moved piece is stopped where the
//   capture occurred. The moving player is notified of the square where her
//   piece landed, and both players are notified of the capture as stated above.
// - If a player attempts to make an illegal pawn attack or pawn forward-move or
//   castle, she is notified that her move did not succeed and her move is over.
//   Castling through check is allowed, however, as the notion of check is
//   removed.
// - There is a "pass" move, where a player can move nothing.
//
// There are some differences to the original rules [1,2]:
//
// > "All rules associated with stalemates or automatic draw conditions are
// >  eliminated"
//
// Automatic draws are made after the same board repeats itself 3 times
// in the game (kNumRepetitionsToDraw) or after a large number of moves
// (kNumReversibleMovesToDraw). This is to make sure that random play
// in the game would stop after a limited number of steps.
//
// > "Turn phase: [..] if the opponent captured a piece on their turn,
// >  the current player is given the capture square"
//
// Turn phase is eliminated: all the capture information can be deduced as the
// difference of player's pieces observations in the sensing phase.
//
// > "Sense phase: the player chooses any square on the chessboard to target
// >  their sensor. Then, the true state of the game board in a three square by
// >  three square window centered at the chosen square is revealed to the
// >  sensing player."
//
// Sensing is done as picking a sensing window that fully fits within the
// chessboard and is not centered on an underlying square. The centering can
// make the sensing window smaller (as a rectangle near the border of the
// chessboard) which gives strictly less information than a better placed window
// (that remains a full square). This modification eliminates strategically
// useless sensing actions.
//
// > "If the move was modified [..] then the modified move is made, and
// >  the current player is notified of the modified move in the move results."
//
// All the modifications can be deduced through the observations provided
// by the observation tensors or strings and are not given explicitly.
