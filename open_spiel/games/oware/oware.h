// Oware (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware) is a strategy game within the
// family of Mancala games. Several variations of the game exist. This
// implementation uses the basic rules as described here:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware or here:
// http://www.joansala.com/auale/rules/en/.
//
// In particular if the opponent has no seeds, the current player must make a
// move to give the opponent seeds. If no such move exists the game ends and the
// current player collects the seeds in his row. If at the end of an action the
// opponent would be left with no seeds because they would all be captured
// (a Grand Slam), no seeds are captured instead.
//
// When the game reaches a state which occurred before, it ends and both players
// collect the remaining seeds in their respective rows.
//
// Note: The Kalah game is also available separately in mancala.{h,cc}.
