// Implementation of a mean field routing game.
//
// The game is derived from https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11943.
// This game is also implemented in python, see
// open_spiel/python/mfg/games/dynamic_routing.py.
// The list of vehicles decribing the N player of the dynamic routing game is
// replaced by a list of OriginDestinationDemand. One OriginDestinationDemand
// corresponds to one population of vehicles (with the same origin, destination
// and departure time).
//
// This game is a variant of the mean field route choice game
// (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8619448) as the vehicle
// movement depends on the current network congestion. In the mean field route
// choice game, the number of time steps to reach the destination is constant
// and does not depend on the network congestion, neither of the vehicle cost
// function. In the dynamic driving and routing game
// (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103189), the vehicle choose its
// speed to travel on each link in order to minimize its cost function.
// Therefore the congestion is encoded in the cost function.
//
// More context can be found on the docstring of the python_dynamic_routing
// class.
