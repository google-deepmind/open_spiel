// Parametric two-player Battleship game, as introduced in [1]. It is inspired
// by the famous [board game][wikipedia].
//
//
// Game dynamics
// =============
//
// > The following description is loosely taken from the
// > [Wikipedia page][wikipedia] for the Battlship game.
//
// The game is played on two grids, one for each player. The grids have equal
// size, specifically `board_height` rows and `board_width` columns, where
// `board_height` and `board_width` are parameters passed to the generator.
//
// [wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
//
// The game has two phases: ship placement and war:
//
// Ship placement phase
// --------------------
//
// During the ship placement phase, each player secretly arranges their ships
// on their grid. The players alternate placing one ship at a time, without
// revealing the ships' positions.
//
// Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged
// either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is
// determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one
// ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The lengths and values of
// ships are the same for each player.
//
// The number of ships, as well as their lengths and values are parameters that
// can be specified at game generation time.
//
// War phase
// ---------
//
// After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds with `num_rounds`
// rounds. In each round, each player (starting from Player 1) takes a turn to
// announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at.
// Depending on the flags passed in to the generator, a player might or might
// not be able to shoot in a previously-selected position (default: no).
//
// The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. When
// all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announce the
// sinking of the ship.
//
// If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over.
//
// Payoff computation
// ------------------
//
// The game payoffs are computed based on the following two quantities:
//
// - `damage_pl1`: this is the sum of values of Player 1's ships that have been
// sunk by Player 2.
// - `damage_pl2`: this is the sum of values of Player 2's ships that have been
// sunk by Player 1.
//
// The payoff for Player 1 is computed as `damage_pl2 - loss_multiplier *
// damage_pl1`, while the payoff for Player 2 is symmetrically computed as
// `damage_pl1 - loss_multiplier * damage_pl2`, where `loss_multiplier` is a
// parameter to the generator.
//
// When `loss_multiplier = 1`, the game is zero-sum.
// Note that currently no partial credit is awarded to a player that hit but did
// not sink a ship.
//
// Game size
// ---------
//
// The number of states / information sets / sequences in Battleship is
// exponential in the number of cells on the boards, as well as in the number of
// turns.
//
// For example, on a 10x10 board, each player has 100^{number of turns} possible
// actions. On the game with default parameters (see below), the number of
// states is in the order of (at least) 10^200.
//
//
// Even apparently small games are very complex and exhibit a large number of
// states. For example, using allow_repeated_shots = False:
//
// +-------+-------+-------+-----------------+----------------+----------+
// |  Grid | Shots |  Ship |  Num sequences  |  Num infosets  | Terminal |
// |       |       | sizes |   pl 0 |   pl 1 |  pl 0 |   pl 1 |  states  |
// +-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+----------+
// | 2 x 2 |     2 |   [1] |    165 |    341 |    53 |    109 |     1072 |
// | 2 x 2 |     3 |   [1] |    741 |    917 |   341 |    397 |     2224 |
// | 2 x 2 |     2 | [1;2] |   1197 |   3597 |   397 |   1189 |     9216 |
// | 2 x 2 |     3 | [1;2] |  13485 |  22029 |  6541 |  10405 |    32256 |
// +-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+-------+--------+----------+
// | 2 x 3 |     2 |   [1] |    943 |   3787 |   187 |    751 |    19116 |
// | 2 x 3 |     3 |   [1] |  15343 |  46987 |  3787 |  11551 |   191916 |
// | 2 x 3 |     4 |   [1] | 144943 | 306187 | 46987 |  97951 |   969516 |
