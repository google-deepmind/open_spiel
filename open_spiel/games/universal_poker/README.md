# Universal Poker support

This has been contributed by dennisjay in November 2019 (See
https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/pull/97), and is available as an optional
dependency. See the
[https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/blob/master/docs/install.md](install.md)
for documentation and `open_spiel/scripts/global_variables.sh` to enable this.

This is a wrapper around the Annual Computer Poker Competition bot (ACPC)
environment. See http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/. The code is initially
available at https://github.com/ethansbrown/acpc

Thanks to dennisjay for contributing this to the community! If it's useful to
you, feel free to help supporting it. It has not been extensively reviewed or
tested by the DeepMind OpenSpiel team.
