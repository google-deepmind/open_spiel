# Slovenian Tarok Card Game
[Slovenian Tarok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nigrufen#Slovenia) is a variant of central European [Tarot card games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_card_games). It is essentially a three- or four-player, trick-taking, competitive game of skill with bidding. Computationally speaking, Tarok is moderately more complex than Bridge [[1]](#references). Detailed game rules are available at https://www.pagat.com/tarot/sltarok.html.

The environment was implemented by [Nejc Ilenic](https://github.com/inejc) and [Tim Smole](https://github.com/TimSmole); the original repository is available at https://github.com/semanticweights/tarok.

Note that the current implementation is a full game without the [announcements](https://www.pagat.com/tarot/sltarok.html#announcements). The game is fully playable nevertheless as announcements can be considered an optional addition which will be added in a future PR.
