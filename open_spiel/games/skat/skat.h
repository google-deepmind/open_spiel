// A slightly simplified version of Skat.
// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)
// This is a 3 player trick-based card game. After cards are dealed a bidding
// phase decides which player is the solo player and what game type is played.
// After the bidding phase, there is a phase where the solo players takes up the
// two cards in the Skat and discards two cards (whose points are secured for
// the solo player). After that the playing phase starts.
//
// Currently the bidding is vastly simplified. The players are allowed to make
// bids or not in order. The first player who makes a bid is the solo player.
// Allowed bids are only the 6 game types (4 suits, Grand & Null). This means
// Hand and Ouvert games are currently not implemented.
//
// The play phase consists of 10 tricks. The utility is the points made minus 60
// and divided by 120 for the solo player and 240 for the team players. This
// makes it a zero-sum game and since there are 120 points in total, each side
// gets a positive score if they get more than half the points.
//
// The action space is as follows:
//   0..31     Cards, used for dealing, discarding and playing cards.
//   32+       Bidding, currently you can only bid for a game type.
