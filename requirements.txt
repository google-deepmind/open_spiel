# The core OpenSpiel pip dependencies.
#
# Note that there are optional python packages used by some of the python
# algorithms or tools in OpenSpiel that are purposely excluded (e.g.,
# cvxopt, nashpy, matplotlib, etc.) This is because we want to keep only
# the dependencies that are absolutely necessary to use the Python API.
#
# However, when testing using continuous integration like GitHub Actions,
# we install several more packages to ensure the proper tests are
# included. See open_spiel/scripts/python_extra_deps.sh for the extra
# packages and their versions we use for testing purposes.
